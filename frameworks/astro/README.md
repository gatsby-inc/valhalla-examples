# Welcome to [Valhalla + Astro](https://astro.build)

[View the live site](https://astro-valhalla.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

1. `yarn` to install dependencies
2. `yarn dev` to spin up local dev server
3. Profit!

## Note

The Astro example is relatively simplified as of now. We have not built out the other pieces of the site (blog, store, etc.) but plan to in the future. For now, it's more of a proof of concept, and PRs are very welcome to build out more of the feature set!
