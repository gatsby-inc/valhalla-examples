  Pet Snuggles -  Valhalla + Gatsby
</h1>

## Getting started

Note, this repository itself is primarily used by the Gatsby team. You're welcome to poke around the code and see a well-structured Gatsby app with different rendering modes, but it's primarily used to set up the hosted GraphQL API (powered by Valhalla) that enables building other frameworks (like Next.js, Astro, etc.) based upon that API.
